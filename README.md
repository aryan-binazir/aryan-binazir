### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer based in Raleigh-Durham, NC, with multiple years of experience in Go, JavaScript, Ruby, React, SQL, MongoDB, Docker, and cloud platforms such as AWS, Digital Ocean, and Heroku.

Recently, I designed and built [Triage](https://team-triage.github.io), an open-source Kafka consumer proxy that solves head-of-line blocking.
